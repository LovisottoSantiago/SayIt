## Overview
"Say it" is designed with the primary goal of improving your spoken English. While it indirectly supports vocabulary enhancement, the main focus is on helping users practice and perfect their pronunciation and fluency in a safe, structured environment. The app uses a combination of random phrase generation, text-to-speech (TTS), and voice recognition to create a dynamic practice experience.

<a name="features"/>

## Features
### üéØ Targeted Phrase Generation
Choose from five diverse categories‚ÄîEntertainment, Travel and Places, Food and Drink, Daily Life, and Jobs and Careers. Each category contains a wide array of phrases tailored to real-life scenarios, helping you practice speaking in contexts that matter.

### üîä Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration
Listen to the generated phrase by clicking the speaker button. The current TTS system uses an open-source library that provides clear and accurate pronunciation, though we‚Äôre actively working on upgrading it for even better performance.

### üé§ Voice Recognition with Sphinx
Click the audio button to start the voice recognition process. We‚Äôve integrated the Sphinx library, known for its precise command recognition capabilities. While Sphinx excels in specific scenarios, it requires users to pronounce phrases correctly for optimal results‚Äîadding an extra layer of challenge and learning.

### üß† Levenshtein Distance for Accuracy Assessment
To ensure that you're saying the phrases correctly, "Say it" uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm. This string metric measures the difference between your spoken input and the generated phrase, calculating how many single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) are needed to match the two sequences. The app then provides immediate feedback‚Äîeither "Success" or "Wrong"‚Äîbased on the accuracy of your pronunciation.

### üí¨ Real-time Feedback
Receive instant feedback on your pronunciation accuracy.

### üöÄ Open Source and Extensible
"Say it" is an open-source project, meaning it's designed to grow and evolve with contributions from developers like you. We're excited to see what the community can build upon this foundation.

## How It Works
* **Choose a Category:** Upon launching the app, select a category that interests you. Each category is packed with relevant phrases.

* **Generate a Phrase:** Once you‚Äôve selected your category, click the "Generate Phrase" button to see a new phrase. This phrase will be your speaking challenge.

* **Listen to the Phrase:** Unsure how to pronounce the phrase? No worries! Click the speaker button to hear the phrase spoken aloud. The TTS system reads it out clearly for you to mimic.

* **Speak the Phrase:** Ready to give it a shot? Click the audio button to start the voice recognition process. Say the phrase as accurately as possible.

* **Get Instant Feedback:** After you‚Äôve spoken, the app compares your input with the original phrase using the Levenshtein distance algorithm and gives you instant feedback. Did you nail it, or is there room for improvement?

## Java Classes
* Phrase: This class is responsible for generating random phrases. It pulls phrases from ArrayLists based on the selected category.
* Score: Implements the algorithm for evaluating the user's spoken phrase against the generated phrase using the Levenshtein distance. This class determines if the user's pronunciation was accurate or if corrections are needed.
* Voice: Handles the voice recognition process using the Sphinx library. It captures the user's spoken input and prepares it for comparison.
* TextTTS: Converts the generated text phrases into speech using the TTS library. While the current implementation serves its purpose, future updates will bring significant improvements in voice quality and naturalness.
