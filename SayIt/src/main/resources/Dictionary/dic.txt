Stephen King writes
The Dark Tower rises
A ghost haunts
A child discovers
A writer struggles
The clown terrifies
A town secrets
The monster emerges
A family unravels            
The hotel beckons
The wizard casts
Harry Potter learns
Hermione studies
Ron Weasley jokes
A spell backfires           
The owl delivers
A potion brews
The broomstick flies
Dumbledore advises
Voldemort plots
The calculus student solves           
The derivative measures
The integral calculates
A function graphs
A limit approaches
A sequence converges
The theorem proves            
An equation balances
The variable changes
The curve bends          
Buenos Aires shines
An Argentine tango
A gaucho rides
The pampas stretch
A football match
The Andes tower
A Malbec pours
The mate circulates
The asado sizzles
San Martin studies
The glacier calms
A street artist
The plaza fills
A train travels
The wine vineyard            
A mountain trail

in Derry, Maine
in the eerie woods         
in the basement
on the isolated island
in the dark room 
at the creepy carnival
at Hogwarts
in the Forbidden Forest
in the Potions class
in the Gryffindor common room
in the Quidditch match
in Diagon Alley
in the Chamber of 
in the Great Hall
at Hogsmeade
in the Room of Requirement
during the exam
on the coordinate plane
under the curve
within the limit
in the complex plane
on the function's graph
within the series
under the theorem
on the x-axis
at the point of inflection
in the heart of Buenos Aires.
on the dance floor
across the pampas 
in the football stadium
in the Andes
in the vineyard
at the asado
around the mate circle
in the shadow of the glacier
in the street market
at the Obelisk
through the subway
on the mountain path
along the coast
near the river delta
in the Patagonian steppe
